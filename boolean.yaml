# ================================
# Boolean Representation in YAML
# YAML supports multiple ways to express boolean values
# true = 1 / enabled / active
# false = 0 / disabled / inactive
# ================================

# ----------------
# Type 01: Standard Booleans
# Most explicit and widely used (preferred in modern tools like Kubernetes, Ansible)
# ----------------
deploy_1: true     # Equivalent to 1 (enabled)
deploy_2: false    # Equivalent to 0 (disabled)

# ----------------
# Type 02: Yes/No
# Also valid YAML booleans (internally converted to true/false)
# ----------------
deploy_3: yes      # Interpreted as true
deploy_4: no       # Interpreted as false

# ----------------
# Type 03: On/Off
# These are also valid and treated as booleans in YAML
# ----------------
deploy_5: on       # Interpreted as true
deploy_6: off      # Interpreted as false
