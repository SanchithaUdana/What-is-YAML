# Type 01: List of Objects
# Each item in the list is a full app configuration
# Useful when managing multiple app versions or services
# ================================

new-version:
  - architechture: micro-service      # Architecture type of the service
    application: sample-app-1         # Name of the application
    expose-port: 8080                 # Port exposed to the outside
    version: 1.0.0                    # Specific version of the app

  - architechture: micro-service
    application: sample-app-2

# ================================
# Type 02: Single Object with a List Value
# The version key holds a list of version values
# Useful when one app supports multiple versions
# ================================

sample-app-version1:
  architechture: micro-service        # Common architecture
  application: sample-app-2           # App name is fixed
  expose-port: 8080                   # Port is the same for all versions
  version: 
    - 1.0.0                           # List of supported versions
    - 2.0.0

# ================================
# Type 03: Compact List Representation
# Same as Type 02 but version list is inline
